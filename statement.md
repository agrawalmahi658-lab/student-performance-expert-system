🎓 Project Statement – Student Performance Expert System (Prolog)
---
📘 1. Problem Statement
---
Students often wonder:
“Kya mere study habits mujhe pass karwa payenge?”

Teachers also need a quick tool to estimate student performance without calculations.

A Prolog-based Expert System solves this by using logical rules to predict whether a student will PASS or FAIL in seconds — no machine learning required.

🎯 2. Scope of the Project
---
This project covers the complete working of a Rule-Based Expert System including:

🟦 User Inputs:

📘 Study hours per day

📝 Attendance percentage

🧪 Previous exam marks

🟪 System Processing:

Matches inputs with rules

Uses Prolog inference engine

Finds the best rule that applies

🟩 Output:

🎉 PASS

❌ FAIL

System is lightweight, fast, and ideal for AI fundamentals.

👥 3. Target Users
---
This expert system is useful for:

🎓 Students

👨‍🏫 Teachers / Mentors

🤖 AI beginners learning Prolog

🧠 Anyone studying Expert Systems

💡 4. High-Level Features
---
✨ Highly interactive, question-based interface
📚 Easy-to-understand rule system
🧠 Automatic inference (Prolog engine)
⚡ Instant PASS/FAIL prediction
🔧 Easily extendable rules
❗ Zero machine learning needed

🎯 5. Project Objectives
---
Represent knowledge using logical rules

Demonstrate expert system architecture

Use Prolog inference to automate decision-making

Build a simple, clean, understandable AI project

Provide explainable PASS/FAIL predictions

🧠 6. Why Use Prolog?
---
Prolog is perfect for AI fundamentals because:

🧩 Natural fit for rules and logic

🔄 Automatic rule matching

🧵 Pattern matching & backtracking

🪶 Simple and concise syntax

🧠 Real expert system reasoning

📘 Ideal for academic demonstrations

🎯 7. Expected Output
---
The system will predict either:

✔ PASS

If study hours, attendance, and marks satisfy rule conditions.

❌ FAIL

If values fall below the required thresholds.

The output is clear, direct, and rule-based.

📦 8. Deliverables
---
This project includes:

🧠 student_performance.pl (Prolog expert system code)

📄 README.md (separate repository)

🗂️ statement.md (this file)

📘 Complete Project Report PDF (submitted separately)

🏁 9. Conclusion
---
The Student Performance Expert System is a powerful demonstration of:

Expert systems

Logical reasoning

Inference-based decision making

Prolog programminginference to make decisions.
The project is easy to understand, extend, and ideal for academic submission in an AI fundamentals course.
